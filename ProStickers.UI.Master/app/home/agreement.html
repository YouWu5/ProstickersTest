The information is also used to verify your authority to access the Service and to contact you when reasonably necessary.  Babyrific may also use any information you have provided as reasonably necessary to administer or provide customer support for the Service, and to provide you with periodic printed or e-mail communications about new products and services, discounts, special promotions or upcoming events.  You may opt-out of receiving some or all non-Service related communications by updating your profile on the Service.  Also, your full name and email address may be used when you use the Service to send a message to another user. Additionally, we use your email address to contact you on behalf of other friends on the site (such as when another user sends you a message).

You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g. user name, e-mail address) via forums, postings, profiles or other areas of the Service, that information, along with any substantive information disclosed in your communication, can be collected, correlated and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Babyrific. Please do not post any personal information on the Service or in other areas that you expect to keep private.

For this reason you should not disclose information to Babyrific that you do not want shared with third parties.  In addition to the forgoing, Babyrific will disclose your personally identifiable information as it believes is reasonably necessary to comply with law, regulation or other governmental authority or to prevent harm to yourself or others.  Babyrific may also contract with various third parties who help us provide and maintain the Service.  For example, we use a third party to process payments made to us, and may subcontract out production, fulfillment, or other operations. In these cases, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent such third parties from disclosing your personal information, except for the purpose of providing the services in question.  Additionally, as part of the Service, Babyrific will make your profile information available to other users of the Service.  Finally, Babyrific may disclose your personally identifiable information upon a transfer or sale to another entity of all or substantially all of Babyrific’s stock or assets in Babyrific’s line of business to which this Privacy Policy relates or upon any bankruptcy or other corporate reorganization.

Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.
